PROJECT 1
This project will implement two sorting algorithms to sort an alternating set of black and white disks.
The first algorithm is the alternating disk algorithm which is where in each run, every two disks are compared and swapped only if necessary.
The second algorithm is the lawnmower algorithm. It works by starting at the leftmost disk and proceeding to the right until it reaches the end, while comparing every two adjacent disks and swapping them if necessary.
